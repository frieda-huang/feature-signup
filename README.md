## Workflow

- On submitting a Google Form, all fields are automatically converted to an issue with `feature` as a label.
- The issue is then automatically added to the Project `Code&Coffee Feature Signup` and again moved to `Speaker Queue` under the Kanban view

## How does it work?

1. Open the Apps Script editor and selecting "Extensions" â†’ "Apps Script".
2. Upload script.js to Files
3. In the Apps Script editor, click on the "Edit" menu and select "Current project's triggers".
4. Click on the "+ Add Trigger" button at the bottom right of the page.
5. Configure the trigger settings:
   - Choose the function you want to trigger from the "Run" dropdown menu.
   - Choose the event that should trigger the function (e.g., "On form submit" for a Google Form).
   - Adjust any additional settings specific to the chosen event.
6. Click the "Save" button to create the trigger.
