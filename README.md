# Setup

- Create a GitHub Project `Code&Coffee Feature Signup` and a GitHub repository `feature-signup`: link the repositry to the project.
- Add a new label `feature` under Issues tab
- Go to the project `Code&Coffee Feature Signup` and create a board/kanban view, assigning your custom name to a column.
